TIC TAC TOE is a 2D game that i developed to further my skills in C and to get a hang of SDL.

I am new to SDL and this project enabled me to get my hands dirty on rendering graphics, font and other fundamental concepts such as input handling, frame rate, menu systems.

Until now, I have developed some terminal applications using C and created a calculator using the WinAPI. Although this is a beginner level project -- for me, a lot of concepts are brand new and quite complex. One of the biggest challenges of this project was to organize the code and the screen transitions. I don't think I did a good job in either area but you live and learn I suppose.

My next project will involve a "real-time" game such as Break-out or Pong.

Be kind, stay EPIC!
