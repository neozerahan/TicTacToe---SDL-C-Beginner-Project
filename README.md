# Tic Tac Toe - A Beginner SDL Project

![Demo](https://github.com/neozerahan/TicTacToe/blob/main/Others/TicTacToe.gif)

## Description
Tic Tac Toe is a simple 2D game developed to strengthen my skills in C and gain hands-on experience with the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library. This project explores fundamental concepts such as rendering graphics, handling input, frame rate management, and designing menu systems.

## Features
- Graphical user interface with SDL.
- Smooth screen transitions.
- Menu system for starting and resetting the game.
- Basic input handling for player moves.

## Learning Outcomes
This project introduced me to:
- **SDL Basics**: Rendering graphics, fonts, and managing events.
- **Game Development Fundamentals**: Implementing input handling and frame rate control.
- **Code Organization**: Structuring logic for screen transitions and menus.

## Challenges
Organizing the code and managing screen transitions were significant challenges. These experiences taught me valuable lessons about clean coding practices, which I aim to improve in future projects.

## Future Plans
My next project will involve creating a "real-time" game, such as Break-out or Pong, to further develop my skills.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/neozerahan/TicTacToe.git`
2. Run the ./TicTacToe/buildtic.bat 
4. Run the executable: `./TicTacToe/Bin/game.exe`
5. To disable the terminal window while running the .exe, Run the bat file suing the terminal by entering - buildtic.bat f
