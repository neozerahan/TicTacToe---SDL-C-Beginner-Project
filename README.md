TIC TAC TOE is a 2D game that i developed to learn C and SDL.

I am new to SDL and this project enabled me to get my hands dirty on rendering graphics, font and other fundamental concepts such as frame rate, menu system. 
Until now, I have developed terminal applications using C and have created a calculator using the WinAPI.

Although this is a beginner level project, for me, a lot of concepts were brand new and quite complex. My next project will involve a "real-time" game
such as Break-out or Pong.
